Hotel Reservation Program


Write a program that simulates hotel reservation program. Assume that the hotel has 3 wings of 10 rooms each. The program
should display a menu to perform the following operations:

1. Display the number of available rooms in each wing.

2. Make a reservation. The program should prompt the user to enter a wing number. Then, it reserves the first available room
in that wing. If there is no available room, the program should prompt the user to enter a new wing until the reservation is
made.

3. Cancel a reservation. The program should prompt the user to enter the wing number and the room number and cancel the
reservation.
